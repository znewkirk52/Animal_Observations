# Animal_Observations
A tool to identify observation dynamics using data collected from iNaturalist.

In its current state, you can download all the observations for one species in a local park or other area (from iNaturalist) and use this tool to output a chart showing what time of day all the observations are from.
Current personalizations allow you to narrow down a particular month and change the timezone from UTC.
